# Pig Dice Game

This simple dice game was created as a fun side project because I wanted to practice working with Typescript, SCSS in an alternative project structure. As well as practising creating reusable components.

## The Game

Pig is a simple dice game first described in print in 1945. Two players take turns to roll a dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1. The player can choose to hold their turn score which will bank the points and added to your total score. The first player to score 100 or more wins.
